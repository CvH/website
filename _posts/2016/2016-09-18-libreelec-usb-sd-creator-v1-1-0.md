LibreELEC USB-SD Creator v1.1.0 has been released adding user-interface localisations for 21 languages and support for macOS sierra. Currently supported languages are:

- Bulgarian
- Croatian
- Czech
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- Finnish
- French
- German
- Greek
- Hungarian
- Italian
- Norwegian
- Polish
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Serbian
- Slovak
- Slovenian
- Spanish
- Swedish
- Turkish
- Ukranian

If your language is not listed above and you would like to see it added in a future release, or you can see errors in the current translations please register with the [LibreELEC team on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/libreelec/). Once registered you can request a new language to be added or contribute corrections. Thank you to all the users who contributed existing translations!

Creator now runs on macOS sierra but Gatekeeper must be disabled first. This can be done by running the command "sudo spctl --master-disable" using Terminal.app. This is not a positive experience so we are looking into becoming a known Apple developer to avoid this step.

Enjoy :)
