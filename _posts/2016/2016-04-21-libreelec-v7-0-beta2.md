v6.95.2 (Beta 2) resolves video issues for the Raspberry Pi users who comprise a majority of our users. It also prevents a device ID overlap between the bcma/wl wireless drivers in Generic and adds a patch that may reduce (but not eliminate) some “settings lost at shutdown" issues which are an ongoing Kodi problem common to multiple distros. Kodi team are now expected to release 16.1 final next weekend. If this happens “Plan C” will be to release our 7.0.0 build [with new logo branding](https://libreelec.tv/2016/04/heads-up/) during the next week.

**\*\* IMPORTANT \*\***

LibreELEC operates a 24-hour ‘canary’ period between major release files being posted to the download page and the release being available via the auto-update system. This is for two reasons: First, if we find a problem we can pull the files before too many users grab the update. Second, it allows time for the release to propagate among our global network of download mirrors.

If you are running @milhouse or other community builds your system will not auto-update to the beta release. You must first perform a manual update to the beta release. Your system will then auto-update to any further beta releases (although none are planned) and/or the final v7.0.0 release.
