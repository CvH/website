An easy to use application to create bootable USB and SD card installation media has been on the staff wish-list for a long long time, so we are delighted to reveal the official "LibreELEC USB-SD Creator" app for Linux, macOS and Windows.

The app has four clearly marked steps to guide you through downloading the latest official LibreELEC image for your hardware and writing it to removable media, and checking "show all" enables selection of previous releases and current Alpha/Beta preview builds. You can also load a local image file, allowing the app to be used with previously downloaded images, or development and community created images that are not hosted on our official download servers.

The Windows version is compiled 32-bit and should run on Windows XP and newer. The macOS app is 64-bit and should run on 10.9 (Mavericks) and newer. The Linux app is available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions and should run on Ubuntu 14.04 and newer, and other Debian derivatives. The app checks for updates when started and displays a pop-up message if a newer version is available.

The wiki team have created [instructions for the app](https://wiki.libreelec.tv/index.php?title=LibreELEC_USB-SD_Creator), and we have added a [forum area where you can ask for support, provide feedback, and report issues](https://forum.libreelec.tv/forum-41.html).

LibreELEC would like to credit our neighbours and distro collaborators at [RasPlex](http://www.rasplex.com) as the original source of the app's code, and our own @vpeter for his efforts evolving it into the work of art that you can download from today.

Enjoy! :)
