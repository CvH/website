LibreELEC USB-SD Creator v1.2 is released with initial support for right-to-left GUI localisation in Farsi (Persian) and Hebrew, the addition of Lithuanian and Asturian translations, fixes for writing to mmc devices, use behind a proxy server, and other minor issues seen on macOS sierra and Linux since v1.1.

The project team are really happy with the positive reviews the USB-SD Creator app is receiving in blog posts and social media, and website stats show app downloads/week now exceed the number of direct .img file downloads. It's another little reason fuelling rapid growth in our active-install numbers.

If you would like to see a language added in a future release please visit [the LibreELEC team page on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/libreelec/) to request it and (the important bit) contribute translated text strings. Requesting a language does not automatically translate it so if you missed that step please go back to add them.

Enjoy! :)
