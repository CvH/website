The LibreELEC v7.0.1 "noobs" images for Raspberry pi (all versions) were released with a couple of errors which have been corrected. To avoid the confusion of an odd numbered v7.0.1.1 release or rushing v7.0.2 out with only a couple of changes we simply swapped the download files on the server at 5pm GMT today. This exploits the "it didn't work, so I downloaded the image again and made a new SD card and now it works!" trial and error process most first-time noob(s) users follow.

If you are not using noobs, there's nothing to see here, move along please :)
