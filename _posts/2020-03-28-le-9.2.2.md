**LibreELEC 9.2.2 (Leia)** is a Hotfix release just for the x86_64 Generic (PC, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA â€¦) image.
It includes a fix for the missing sound at Intel based systems (mainly NUC) due an Linux Kernel bug.
This is just for the Generic image as the fix only targeting this platform.

**Upgrading**

On first boot the Kodi media database will be upgraded. Depending on your hardware and media collection size this could take several minutes. Please be patient.
