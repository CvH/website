Today we are releasing a LibreELEC update for the 9.2 branch to primarily fix Widevine, its that piece of software that allows playback of Netflix, Amazon Prime and other paid video services.

The new version of widevine (4.10.2252.0 or newer) is mandatory to keep it working after the streaming services finally switched to the new version.  
With that new version (that is taken from ChromeOS) all ARM devices need additional libraries to make it work again.

The update is only available for Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 4 and Slice 3. The fix is already included in our LE10 builds too.  
The Generic (PC / Intel / AMD / Nvidia) images need no changes.
