LibreELEC settings add-on translations have moved from Transifex to the Team Kodi weblate instance. Most of our active translators also contribute to Kodi repo add-ons, so relocating to the same tool makes things easier for them. Weblate will also push translation updates to our repo so changes can be merged in a more timely fashion (Transifex has been a little neglected). Current translation status can be seen here:

NB: If you would like to see the LibreELEC settings add-on translated to your language, it doesn't happen by magic! - Please sign up with Kodi Weblate and contribute the changes.
