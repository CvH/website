LibreELEC 8.2.2 is a minor maintenance release to resolve an ffmpeg issue that allows the legions of 3D movie fans (both of you) to watch them again. It also fixes an issue with the WeTek Core after recent WeOS updates have been installed, adds support for the 2nd generation of RF remote from OSMC, and disables the flashing blue 'activity' LED on the Odroid C2 that most users find annoying. That's all it contains. No package bumps or driver or kernel changes are included, because at this late stage of the release cycle we have no desire to go fix things that might add new bugs.

[See detailed changes on GitHub](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv/compare/8.2.1...8.2.2).

**AUTO UPDATE**

Auto-update will be postponed until December 27 or 28 to ensure project staff focus on their family and friends over Christmas, not forum posts. Until then older releases can be updated to 8.2.2 using the GUI manual update function in the LibreELEC settings add-on.

Happy Holidays!
