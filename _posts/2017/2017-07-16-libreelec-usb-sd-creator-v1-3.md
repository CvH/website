LibreELEC USB-SD Creator v1.3 is released with support for Brazilian Portuguese and Chinese localisations and minor improvements to existing translations. It also adds audible feedback on completion of image download and image writing, and corrects visual sorting for releases with x.x.x.x numbering. The Asturian localisation has been tweaked to show an Asturian (not Spanish) flag icon.

If you would like to see a localisation added in a future release please visit [the LibreELEC team page on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/libreelec/) to request it and contribute the translated text strings. Requesting a new localisation does not automatically translate it!

NB: Transifex currently shows missing and incomplete translations for Arabic and Romanian.

Enjoy! :)
