**UPDATE (26/5): Please use LibreELEC 8.0.2 instead of this temporary release.**

LibreELEC (Krypton) v8.0.0.1 is a limited release for the new [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero-w-joins-family/) built with Kodi v17.1-RC1 and updated firmware/drivers for the Pi Zero W WiFi and Bluetooth devices. This release allows Pi Zero W users to install LibreELEC and experiment before formal support for the Pi Zero W arrives in LibreELEC v8.0.1, which we expect to ship after Kodi v17.1 is released.

[LibreELEC-RPi.arm-8.0.0.1.img.gz](http://releases.libreelec.tv/LibreELEC-RPi.arm-8.0.0.1.img.gz) ([info](http://releases.libreelec.tv/LibreELEC-RPi.arm-8.0.0.1.img.gz?mirrorlist))

To install LibreELEC on a new Pi Zero W download the .img.gz file linked above and use the [LibreELEC USB/SD Creator app](https://libreelec.tv/downloads/) to create a bootable micro SD card. It can also be used to update 8.0.0 installations where the Pi Zero W will boot and run but does not have WiFi and Bluetooth drivers.

If you experience an issue with LibreELEC on Pi Zero W hardware please [report the problem via the forums](http://forum.libreelec.tv/forum-35.html).

Enjoy!
