It's our 1st Birthday, and instead of telling you how much fun it's been to create a huge community around the project and reach 178,000 active installs, or talk about code and developers, we're going to focus on two birthday essentials: looking cool, and cake!

**LOOKING COOL**

Today we are launching [the official LibreELEC apparel store](https://teespring.com/stores/libreelec). Purchasing a [LibreELEC tee-shirt](https://teespring.com/en-GB/libreelec?tsmac=store&tsmic=libreelec#pid=373&cid=100035&sid=front) or [hoodie](https://teespring.com/en-GB/libreelec?tsmac=store&tsmic=libreelec#pid=377&cid=100063&sid=front) allows you to support us (all profits go to the project) and look great at the same time. Whether you need to [stand out in a crowd](https://kodi.tv/kodi-devcon-2016-live-blog/) or impress small children, the LibreELEC apparel store has you covered!

_"any colour you like, as long as it's black!" - Henry Ford_

We are using teespring.com to handle money and logistics. This is the same company Kodi use for their shirts so we know the merchandise is good quality and the service reliable. The LibreELEC store is organised to make a print run every four days (subject to a minimum order volume) and we receive a fixed amount back per-item ordered once a design campaign completes.

**CAKE, CAKE, AND MORE CAKE!**

Small children pointed out that a) [Smarties are available in the same colours](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c5/cc/a1/c5cca124c313e3c68e6d02d62b4b5cc3.jpg) as our logo, and b) Cupcakes with Smarties are tasty! ..which led to some after-school fun and rigorous testing of a LibreELEC cupcake recipe. LibreELEC cupcakes are perfect for celebrating our 1st birthday!

If you celebrate our first birthday with a LibreELEC cupcake please share the pictures (safe for work and kids please) to our social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook. We are fans of sticky fingers and smiley faces.

**CUPCAKE RECIPE**

This recipe makes 12x normal adult-size cupcakes or 24x mini child-size cupcakes similar to the masterpieces of baking shown in the photo above.

- Beat in the eggs a little at a time and stir in vanilla extract.
- Fold in the flour using a large metal spoon, add milk until the mixture is spreadable.
- Spoon the mixture into the paper cases until they are half full.
- Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until golden-brown.
- Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then remove from the tin and cool on a wire rack.

**Ingredients for buttercream icing and decoration:**

- 140g/5oz butter, softened
- 280g/10oz icing sugar

2. Add half the icing sugar and beat into a smooth mixture.
3. Add the remaining icing sugar and one tablespoon of milk.
4. Beat until smooth and creamy.
