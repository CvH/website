On Tuesday 10th we called time on the initial registration of LibreELEC team members and nominations for the board. In total there were 22 people who signed up and 7 who accepted nominations. Our independent helper has emailed Condorcet vote links so members can rank nominees in personal order of preference and cast their vote. We have allowed 10-days for voting, but if all votes have been cast sooner we will end the election and announce the results.

The team has decided to elect a five-person board, and to stop us replacing the entire board at each election the three highest ranked board members will serve a 24-month term while the next two members will serve a 12-month term. This means that each year there will be an opportunity for board changes, but we also ensure continuity.

The first priority for the board will be creating bylaws for the project and then running a membership vote to accept them. The second priority is to agree and assign roles and responsibilities to the board members and establish any other management structures the project deems to be necessary (technical steering committee, infrastructure admin team, etc.).

Next update will be to announce the results!
