LibreELEC (Krypton) 8.2.5 is now available with updates to Raspberry Pi firmware to address issues seen with the initial firmware release supporting the new 3B+ hardware (which also affected the Slice box). We also bump both nVidia drivers in the Generic x86\_64 image, resolve an MCE remote problem, add support for the [WeTek Pro remote control](https://wetek.com/gb/en/product/pro-remote) unit in WeTek images, the [Allo DigiOne DAC](https://www.allo.com/sparky/digione.html) in Raspberry Pi images, and updated u-boot in the Odroid C2 image [now supports mild overclocking](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv/blob/libreelec-8.2/projects/Odroid_C2/bootloader/boot.ini#L124) to boost performance.

[See detailed changes on GitHub](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv/compare/8.2.4...8.2.5).

Enjoy :)
