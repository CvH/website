## LICENSE

LibreELEC is free and Open Source software. This means you are free to clone, use and adapt our software with no licensing fee — as long as you respect the terms of the GPLv2 license. In broad terms the GPLv2 obliges you to provide on request the full sources of what you distribute. This means the sources of all packages that are part of the LibreELEC image including original LibreELEC software, Kodi and all changes/adaptions made to create your own version. To aid compliance it is recommended that you use GitHub to clone LibreELEC sources to your own GitHub repository and then push all changes you make back to the same public repository. This ensures the chain of authorship on code is visible. It also makes upstreaming of fixes and improvements to our main repository easier. As LibreELEC contains original Kodi software you are also subject to terms and conditions of Kodi trademarked items (i.e. the Kodi name and visual marks) contained therein. The Kodi foundation has strict rules on modification — [please understand them](http://kodi.wiki/view/Official:Trademark_Policy).
