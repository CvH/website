Purchasing a [LibreELEC tee-shirt](https://www.libreelec.shop/) or [hoodie](https://www.libreelec.shop/) allows you to support us (all profits go to the project) and look great at the same time. Whether you need to [stand out in a crowd](https://kodi.tv/kodi-devcon-2016-live-blog/) or impress small children, the LibreELEC apparel store has you covered!  

We are using teespring.com to handle money and logistics. This is the same company Kodi use for their shirts so we know the merchandise is good quality and the service reliable. The LibreELEC store is organised to make a print run every four days  and we receive a fixed amount back per-item ordered.
