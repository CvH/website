## FUNDING

Our software is free but running the project is not, so we raise funds via public and corporate donations and a small number of other initiatives.

## PERSONAL DONATIONS

LibreELEC accepts personal donations via PayPal as it allows us to track payment activity with email notifications seen by multiple people to ensure basic oversight and accountability on funds. It doesn’t matter how much you donate, it all helps, and we promise 100% of the funds received go towards our funding goals. If you include a LibreELEC forum username or email address in donation comments we will tag your forum account as a project donor.

## CORPORATE DONATIONS

The project has no commercial sponsors and does not enter into formal financial partnerships. This ensures we remain neutral and can work with everyone in the ecosystem around us on equal terms.

The project encourages the companies who use our free software in their products or services to contribute back to the project. We have non-profit ideals and prefer human and code contributions over financial donations. We will accept samples of hardware to help with testing, but prefer when manufacturers task their staff to get involved and work alongside us to ensure their products are well supported. We accept financial donations, but prefer to receive a small percentage of sales each month or quarter instead of lump-sum payments. Regular donations help our (and your) cash-flow, and we share in the success of your business.

_Please note:_ If you donate the project has no obligation to promote or recommend your product or service. If you donate you may advertise that you donate and may detail how you donate. You may not refer to yourself  as a sponsor or any form of donation as sponsorship of the project.

If you would like to provide corporate support to the project or make a corporate financial donation please contact us on [donations@libreelec.tv](mailto:donations@libreelec.tv) first.
